# crop-nutrient-app
This Streamlit app allows growers and agronomists to compare crop nutrient values with baseline standards. Users can select grower, crop, and nutrient, view interactive charts showing optimum ranges, and download multi-page PDFs of nutrient data for reporting. Data files are included, so no manual uploads are required.
